A full-stack conversational hospital assistant powered by Gemini, LangGraph, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) server-based tool calling — complete with FastAPI backend, TailwindCSS web UI, and PostgreSQL-driven memory and appointment management.

---

## 🚀 Overview
Kailash Hospital AI Agent is an intelligent, full-stack hospital assistant designed to streamline patient interaction, symptom triage, and appointment workflows via natural conversation. It offers a rich chat interface powered by Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash-001) and a modular backend built using LangGraph, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) for advanced tool integration.

**Key Capabilities:**
- 🔍 Answer factual queries about Kailash Hospital (departments, timings, services, etc.)
- 🩺 Perform smart symptom checking with triage suggestions and department routing
- 📅 Handle appointment workflows (viewing, scheduling, updating) using PostgreSQL logic
- 🧠 Track memory, patient state, and chat history persistently via PostgreSQL
- 💬 Serve conversations through a web-based chat UI styled with Tailwind CSS
- 🌐 Use MCP server-based tools (TavilyMCP) for real-time, high-quality web search in symptom triage and information retrieval

## ✨ Features
- **FastAPI-powered Backend:** Robust, asynchronous API layer for the hospital agent.
- **Gemini LLM + LangGraph State Machine:** Structured, node-based reasoning over user messages.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Answers grounded in official Kailash Hospital knowledge base using HuggingFace embeddings + Chroma.
- **PostgreSQL-Based Logic:** Appointment workflows and persistent memory via PostgreSQL.
- **MCP Server Integration:** Uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) for modular tool integration, including TavilyMCP for advanced, real-time web search in medical triage and information flows.
- **Modular Tooling:** Easily extend the agent with new tools and capabilities via the MCP protocol.
- **Beautiful Tailwind UI:** Minimal, responsive HTML+Tailwind interface.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/hospital-agent.git
cd hospital-agent/Hospital_management_system
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Node.js and MCP Tools
- **Node.js** is required for MCP servers. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- MCP tools are run via `npx` (no global install needed):
  - The backend will launch MCP servers using:
    ```bash
    npx -y tavily-mcp@0.1.4
    ```
- **Tavily API Key:**
  - Get your API key from [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com/).
  - Add it to your `.env` file:
    ```env
    TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
    ```

### 4. Environment Setup
- Add your Gemini API key to `.env`:
  ```env
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
  ```
- Prepare `kailash_info.txt` with hospital data (sample provided).
- Set up your PostgreSQL database with the correct schema for appointments/patients.

### 5. Run the FastAPI Server
```bash
uvicorn api_setup:app --reload
```

### 6. Access the UI
Open your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## 💬 Example Interactions

```
User: I have mild chest pain and shortness of breath.
Assistant: These symptoms may indicate a cardiac issue. (Uses MCP tools to search for latest guidelines.) I recommend consulting the Cardiology department. Would you like help accessing appointment options?

## 🧩 MCP Server Integration
- **What is MCP?**
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol for connecting AI agents to external tools and data sources.
  - It enables dynamic, modular tool integration through standardized server interfaces.
- **How is it used?**
  - The backend launches MCP servers (like TavilyMCP) via `npx` and connects using the `mcp` and `langchain-mcp-adapters` Python packages.
  - The symptom checker and other nodes can invoke MCP tools for up-to-date information and external functionality.
- **Current MCP Tools:**
  - **TavilyMCP:** Provides high-quality, real-time web search for medical information and symptom analysis.
- **Setup:**
  - Requires Node.js and appropriate API keys in your `.env` file.
  - No manual server start needed; the backend handles launching MCP servers as needed.
